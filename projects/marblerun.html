                    The SWSC Science Competition includes several engineering-focused events that I’ve participated in,
                    with
                    my most notable result coming from the Marble Run event.

                    The goal of the event is to design a course that keeps a marble moving for as long as possible. *No
                    Electronics*. Most
                    competitors rely on long, shallow switchback tracks to maximize distance and reduce acceleration.
                    While
                    effective in theory, these designs tend to be time-consuming to build and are prone to
                    friction-related
                    failures, where marbles become stuck.

                    My approach instead uses a mechanically governed system to transport the marble, prioritizing
                    controlled
                    motion and reliability over raw track length.

            <h2>The Mechanism</h2>
            <div class="subcard">
                <p>
                    The primary feature of the marble run is a custom 3D-printed lift mechanism designed to vertically
                    transport the marble in a controlled and repeatable manner.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="subcard">
                <p>
                    The system operates by drawing a pulley that raises a bucket-style claw. Once the marble is
                    captured,
                    the pulley lifts the claw to a higher landing platform. At the top of the travel, a secondary
                    mechanical
                    linkage automatically releases the marble onto the platform without requiring external intervention.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="subcard">
                <p>
                    The lifting speed of the pulley is regulated by an escapement mechanism, similar in principle to
                    those
                    used in mechanical clocks. This allows the marble’s motion to be governed mechanically rather than
                    relying on gravity-driven track geometry, providing consistent timing and reducing the risk of
                    friction-related stalls.
